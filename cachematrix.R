## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
# you can use the following functions to get the inverse of a square matrix, and the result will be restored to the cashe, 
# which is to say, the second time you need it, you can get it without any computing process.  

## Write a short comment describing this function
# The function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

        s <- NULL

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
# then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache
